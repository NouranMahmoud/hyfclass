Few of bash commands I like:

$ mkdir <-- this probably going to be my most often used command, this is way faster than using mouse.


My favourite so far:

$touch index.html; touch style.css; code . <--- this allows me in one line of command to create all the files needed for doing homework and open it in VSC.

And lastly

$clear <---- as no one wants to look at all the mess inside CLI :)
